## 1. Documentation

The documents included in this directory provide additional details and recommendations for implementations of the defined API, and its consumers.

## 2. Introduction

The purpose of the Event & Tally specification is to provide a mechanism by which to emit and consume states and state changes issued by sources (sensors, actuators etc). This is by no means a control API and controlling or sending commands to a receiver is out of scope. States sent need to be for general consumption which is to say they should not be sent with a specific receiver in mind (all states need to be consumable by any compatible receiver).

The specification is split into the following sections:

* [Message types](2.0._Message_types.md)
* [Event types](3.0._Event_types.md)
* [Core models](4.0._Core_models.md)
* [Transports](5.0._Transports.md)
  * [MQTT](5.1._Transport_-_MQTT.md)
  * [Websocket](5.2._Transport_-_Websocket.md)  
* [Event & Tally REST API](6.0._Event_and_tally_rest_api.md)
* [Measurement units guidelines](7.0._Measurement_units_guidelines.md)
